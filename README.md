# Cyclomatic complexity
Cyclomatic complexity is a source code complexity measurement that is being correlated to a number of coding errors. It is calculated by developing a Control Flow Graph of the code that measures the number of linearly-independent paths through a program module.
Lower the Program's cyclomatic complexity, lower the risk to modify and easier to understand. 
Cyclomatic complexity = E - N + 2*P 
where,
  E = number of edges in the flow graph.
  N = number of nodes in the flow graph.
  P = number of nodes that have exit points
